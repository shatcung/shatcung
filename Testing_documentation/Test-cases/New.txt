      4.Remove in worker management
      5.Compare extraction rate before removing the worker and after

Case 2:

      2.Take a cast
      3.Choose farm room
      4.Give to the worker thing better than worn
      5.Compare prey rate before transferring worker and after

Result: Until an action is performed that updates a room's mining status, 
  the production remains the same and the player receives significantly fewer resources than he should.

  No need to move, lvl-up, dress the workers, buy prem, wait until the prem ends to update the status of the rooms.
