### Junior QA | Junior GD ðŸ‘‹

<h3>Iâ€™m currently working on multiplayer mobile project as junior qa-gd (will be end soon)</h3>
My working duty is:
 <li>Functional Testing</li>
 <li>Integration Testing</li>
 <li>Feature Quality Assurance</li>
 <li>Making bug-reports</li>
 <li>Making Check-lists</li>
 <li>Work with ingame content</li>
 <li>Work with documentation: testing docs and GDD|Technical Requirements</li>
 <li>Mobile app testing</li>
 
Now I'm want to move forward and get better with QA.
To reach it, I need to learn more and do practice.
 
This is why I want to try work as tester, who will work with test-tools.

In this moment I'm trying to learn Java. I want to become an AQA in future.
My experience doesn't help so much as I was expected and this is dissapointing a little. But I hope that I can get over this problem.
